An Azure subscription is a logical container used to provision related business or technical resources in Azure. It holds the details of all your resources like virtual machines (VMs), databases, and more. When you create an Azure resource like a VM, you identify the subscription it belongs to. It allows you to delegate access through role-based access-control mechanisms. -https://abouttmc.com

The Azure portal is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools. You can manage your Azure subscription with the Azure portal. Build, manage, and monitor everything from simple web apps to complex cloud deployments. Create custom dashboards for an organized view of resources and configure accessibility options for the best experience. -https://learn.microsoft.com/
